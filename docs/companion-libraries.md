## Helper Libraries

### [React Final Form Listeners](https://github.com/final-form/react-final-form-listeners)

### [Define Form](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/define-form/tree/master/packages/define-form) and [React Define Form](https://github.com/ForbesLindesay/define-form/tree/master/packages/react-define-form)

Define Form offers alternative typescript bindings for Final Form. The key difference is that _the form data is now a strongly typed object_, rather than an `any`. This makes the `initialValues` config option required.
